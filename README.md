# 📍 PinPoint  
*A personal SwiftUI side project built alongside my ICT engineering studies*

## Overview  
**PinPoint** is a side project alongside my ICT engineering studies at LTH**.  
I wanted to challenge myself with a project that combines **interaction design**,  
**mobile app development**, and **real-time data**, while also being genuinely useful  
in everyday life.

The result is an iOS app that helps users explore and keep track of meaningful places.

## Features  
- **Save favorite places** to your personal list  
- **Social features** — follow friends and explore each other’s saved lists  
- **Discover new places** based on your current location  
- **View detailed place information** (address, rating, website, phone number, etc.)  
- **Browse photos**, opening hours, and map location  

The social layer makes the experience feel personal and engaging:  
you can instantly discover cafés, parks, restaurants, and hidden gems your friends love.

## Why I Built It  
This project began as a *“Can I actually build this?”* idea and turned into a full SwiftUI application.  
Through PinPoint, I’ve worked on:

- SwiftUI view composition & layout  
- MVVM architecture  
- Google Places SDK integration  
- Asynchronous image loading  
- Handling real-world API data  
- Designing user journeys and interactions  
- MapKit and location handling

## Tech Stack  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **MapKit**  
- **Google Places SDK**  
- **MVVM Architecture**

## Future Plans  
- Friend activity feed  
- Shared lists & recommendations  
- More advanced filtering and discovery  
- Backend integration for social features
